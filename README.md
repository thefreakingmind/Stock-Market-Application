# Stock Market Data Prediction Application
**Creating an Application to Predict Stock Market and Get Rich as quick as Possible**


## Understanding Stock Market
**Stock Market works on the basic principal of investing at right time and get a good return**

## Libraries Used
**Numpy**
**Pandas**
**Tensorflow**
**Matplotlib**


## Tasks
* Collecting Historic Data for Stock Market.
* Building a Pipeline for Data Processing and Cleaning Stock Data.
* Removing The Nan Values and Later will use Sklearn library to Compute the mean and will replace those.
* Creating the Basic Linear Regression Model.



## Technical Challenges
**Building a Neural Network and Set High Frequency Trading System improving The Performance**.
**Use GRU instead of LSTM to improve efficiency of the Network**
**Live Data Pipeline for this work**.
**Train The Model on Existing Data and Predict without Live Data Pipeline**.


## Aim
* Build a Neural Network(Recurrent Neural Network) and Use Live Data Pipeline for Real time Prediction
* Wallet System for Users to Directly invest in the stock market from their phone or AI can invest for them at real time.
* Bank Accout to Deposite Profit.
